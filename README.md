I am a tech enthusiast and a self-taught frontend developer. I love UI Design and developing for the web mostly with [React](https://reactjs.org/). I have also dabbled with Angular, Node, MongoDB to build fullstack side projects. I am currently getting my hands dirty with DSA, Python and AWS. Quite an eventful time.
