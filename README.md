## Hello Everyone 👋

Hi, I am Shaiju, a tech enthusiast and a self-taught web developer from Hyderabad, India 🇮🇳. I love creating UI Designs and developing for the web mostly with React. I have also dabbled with Angular, Node, MongoDB to build fullstack side projects. I am currently getting my hands dirty with DSA, Python, GraphQL and AWS. Quite an eventful time. I am also an amateur photographer 📷 and an occassional blogger and guitar player 🎸.
